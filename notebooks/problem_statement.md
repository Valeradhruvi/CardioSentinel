--> Problem Statement <--

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. 
Early prediction using patient health indicators can help in preventive treatment.

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict whether a 
person is likely to have cardiovascular disease based on various health parameters.
